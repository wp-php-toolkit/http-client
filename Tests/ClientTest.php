        PREFACE TO PYGMALION.

        A Professor of Phonetics.

        As will be seen later on, Pygmalion needs, not a preface, but a sequel,
        which I have supplied in its due place. The English have no respect for
        their language, and will not teach their children to speak it. They
        spell it so abominably that no man can teach himself what it sounds
        like. It is impossible for an Englishman to open his mouth without
        making some other Englishman hate or despise him. German and Spanish
        are accessible to foreigners: English is not accessible even to
        Englishmen. The reformer England needs today is an energetic phonetic
        enthusiast: that is why I have made such a one the hero of a popular
        play. There have been heroes of that kind crying in the wilderness for
        many years past. When I became interested in the subject towards the
        end of the eighteen-seventies, Melville Bell was dead; but Alexander J.
        Ellis was still a living patriarch, with an impressive head always
        covered by a velvet skull cap, for which he would apologize to public
        meetings in a very courtly manner. He and Tito Pagliardini, another
        phonetic veteran, were men whom it was impossible to dislike. Henry
        Sweet, then a young man, lacked their sweetness of character: he was
        about as conciliatory to conventional mortals as Ibsen or Samuel
        Butler. His great ability as a phonetician (he was, I think, the best
        of them all at his job) would have entitled him to high official
        recognition, and perhaps enabled him to popularize his subject, but for
        his Satanic contempt for all academic dignitaries and persons in
        general who thought more of Greek than of phonetics. Once, in the days
        when the Imperial Institute rose in South Kensington, and Joseph
        Chamberlain was booming the Empire, I induced the editor of a leading
        monthly review to commission an article from Sweet on the imperial
        importance of his subject. When it arrived, it contained nothing but a
        savagely derisive attack on a professor of language and literature
        whose chair Sweet regarded as proper to a phonetic expert only. The
        article, being libelous, had to be returned as impossible; and I had to
        renounce my dream of dragging its author into the limelight. When I met
        him afterwards, for the first time for many years, I found to my
        astonishment that he, who had been a quite tolerably presentable young
        man, had actually managed by sheer scorn to alter his personal
        appearance until he had become a sort of walking repudiation of Oxford
        and all its traditions. It must have been largely in his own despite
        that he was squeezed into something called a Readership of phonetics
        there. The future of phonetics rests probably with his pupils, who all
        swore by him; but nothing could bring the man himself into any sort of
        compliance with the university, to which he nevertheless clung by
        divine right in an intensely Oxonian way. I daresay his papers, if he
        has left any, include some satires that may be published without too
        destructive results fifty years hence. He was, I believe, not in the
        least an ill-natured man: very much the opposite, I should say; but he
        would not suffer fools gladly.
